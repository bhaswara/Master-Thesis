# Master-Thesis
This repository contains my thesis files including the codes and the papers. My thesis was related to feature extraction for face recognition system using autoencoder. In this thesis, I tried several autoencoder models such as variational autoencoder, adversarial autoencoder, and wasserstein autoencoder. I also did a little modification on wasserstein autoencoder by changing its network using residual network. The results of this thesis show that using deeper network gives higher accuracy. 
The autoencoder results for different latent dimension size are shown in the image below.
